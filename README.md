# CIS-4930-Group
The initial file main.py is the starting and database testing file we are using to get a handle on pymongo and its operations as well as working with pandas and numpys to have
the graph based output we desire for the final program.
- We plan on using most of what's written here and optimizing it so that it works well and quickly with large datasets in
  a planned UI.
- Most testing functions and other testing data (such as the format of the Stats collection's datetime) will be removed or modified
  once we're comfortable with the output.
- The database will also be eventually updated to utilize the MongoDB cloud as to make it simpler for independent programming
  and using large sets of test data with the current functions.
- More functionality with MatPlotLib and including numpy arrays to handle large integer data is also planned.
- Also, please note that a lot of our work is done together in these early stages, so the GitHub history log will only reflect
  Independent work if not pushed by rl18c.
